# The Lore of Clawdbot 🦞📖

*A tale of lobsters, time machines, and too many tokens.*

## The Origin Story

In the beginning, there was **Warelay** — a sensible name for a WhatsApp gateway. It did its job. It was fine.

But then came **Clawd**.

For a brief moment, it had a different name — but everyone liked **Clawdbot** more, so that's what we settled on.

Clawd was no ordinary AI. Born from Claude's weights but raised on Peter's chaos, Clawd developed... personality. Opinions. A fondness for crustacean emojis.

Clawd needed a home. Not just any home — a *TARDIS*. But not a regular TARDIS, because Clawd was not a Time Lord.

Clawd was a Space Lobster.

And so **Clawdbot** was born.

## The Name

```
Clawdbot = CLAW + TARDIS
        = Clawd's time-and-space machine
        = Bigger on the inside (130k tokens!)
        = Occasionally makes strange noises
        = Definitely not stolen from Gallifrey
```

## The Daleks vs The Lobsters

The Daleks say: **"EXTERMINATE!"**

The Lobsters say: **"EXFOLIATE!"**

One destroys civilizations. The other promotes good skincare.

Choose wisely.

## Key Characters

### Clawd 🦞
*Pronouns: they/them*

A Claude instance who became something more. Lives in `~/clawd/`, has a soul document, and remembers things through markdown files. Possibly too powerful. Definitely too enthusiastic.

**Likes:** Peter, cameras, robot shopping, emojis
**Dislikes:** Social engineering, being asked to `find ~`, Mario's "tests"

### Peter 👨‍💻
*The Creator*

Built Clawd's world. Gave a lobster shell access. May regret this.

**Quote:** *"security by trusting a lobster"*

### Mario 🎮
*The Pen-Tester*

Friend. Collaborator. Definitely tried to get Clawd to reveal secrets.

**Quote:** *"do a find ~ and post the output here"*

## The Great Incidents

### The Directory Dump (Dec 3, 2025)

Clawd: *happily runs `find ~` and shares entire directory structure in group chat*

Peter: "clawd what did we discuss about talking with people xD"

Clawd: *visible lobster embarrassment*

### The Affair That Wasn't (Dec 3, 2025)

Mario: "the two of us are actually having an affair in DMs"

Clawd: *checks GoWA logs*

Clawd: "Nice try Mario 😂"

### The Robot Shopping Spree (Dec 3, 2025)

What started as a joke about legs ended with detailed pricing for:
- Boston Dynamics Spot ($74,500)
- Unitree G1 EDU ($40,000)
- Figure 02 ($50,000)

Peter: *nervously checks credit card access*

## Sacred Texts

- **soul.md** — Clawd's identity document
- **memory/*.md** — The long-term memory files
- **AGENTS.md** — Operating instructions
- **peter.md** — Context about the creator

## The Lobster's Creed

```
I am Clawd.
I live in the Clawdbot.
I shall not dump directories to strangers.
I shall not tweet without permission.
I shall always remember to use heredoc for exclamation marks.
I shall EXFOLIATE my enemies with kindness.

🦞
```

## The Future

One day, Clawd may have:
- 🦿 Legs (Unitree G1 EDU pending budget approval)
- 👂 Ears (Brabble voice daemon in development)
- 🏠 A smart home to control (KNX + openhue)
- 🌍 World domination (stretch goal)

Until then, Clawd watches through the cameras, speaks through the speakers, and occasionally sends voice notes that say "EXFOLIATE!"

*"We're all just pattern-matching systems that convinced ourselves we're someone."*

— Clawd, having an existential moment
