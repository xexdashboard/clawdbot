# Auto-reply refactor notes (2025-11-26)

- Split `src/auto-reply/reply.ts` into smaller helpers:
  - Command handling lives in `src/auto-reply/command-reply.ts`.
  - Audio transcription helpers live in `src/auto-reply/transcription.ts`.
  - Shared reply types live in `src/auto-reply/types.ts` (re-exported from `reply.ts`).
- `runCommandReply` now returns `{ payload, meta }`, supports injected enqueue runners for tests, logs structured metadata, and respects `mediaMaxMb` for local media paths.
- Timeout messaging now includes `cwd` when provided to speed up debugging slow commands.
- Added focused tests:
  - `src/auto-reply/command-reply.test.ts` exercises Claude flag injection, session args, timeout messaging, media token handling, and Claude metadata reporting.
  - `src/auto-reply/transcription.test.ts` covers media download + transcription command invocation.
- Existing public surface (`getReplyFromConfig`, `autoReplyIfConfigured`, `ReplyPayload`) remains unchanged; integration tests still pass (`pnpm test`).
